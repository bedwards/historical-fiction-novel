This is an autonomous novel-writing factory built on Claude Code. The system uses an AI orchestrator to manage the entire pipeline from conception through publication — planning story structure, delegating prose to specialized writer agents one page at a time, running automated consistency checks against a YAML story bible, and publishing finished manuscripts as EPUB, PDF, and audiobook. Everything lives in a git repository with a strict editorial workflow: each chapter gets its own branch, each page gets committed as written, and every PR is reviewed before merging to main. The methodology rejects off-the-shelf story formulas in favor of a custom Seven-Layer Narrative Architecture synthesized from twelve frameworks (Truby, McKee, Story Grid, Dramatica, Kishotenketsu, among others), and the prose style is calibrated against actual passages from literary masters like Hilary Mantel, Umberto Eco, and Cormac McCarthy. The first novel in progress is The Feast of Ashes, a literary historical fiction set in 1490s Venice and Murano about a Jewish lens grinder's apprentice caught between the secrets of Murano's glass furnaces and the political machinations of the Republic — Book One of The Burning Glass trilogy.
