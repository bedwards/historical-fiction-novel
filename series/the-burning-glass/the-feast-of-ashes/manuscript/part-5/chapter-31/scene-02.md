The door opened without a knock.

Enzo was standing at the table, his hands flat on the wood, and he turned at the sound of the latch and she was there. Serena. In the doorway of the Sforno house with the calle dark behind her and a shawl pulled over her hair and her breathing uneven from the stairs, from the crossing, from whatever it had cost her to walk through the streets of Cannaregio to this door.

She stepped inside and closed the door behind her. Her eyes moved across the room. The table, the stools, the kiddush cup on its shelf. The herbs hung from the ceiling beam, dried and brittle. Giacomo's workbench against the far wall, the tools in their places, the dust.

She looked at him. He was wearing a linen shirt, untucked, and hose, and nothing else. No doublet. No badge. No yellow circle sewn to his chest, no mark of the law's insistence on naming him before he spoke. She looked at the place where it usually was, the center of his chest, and what she saw was cloth and the body beneath it, unmarked, the same as any other body.

Neither of them spoke. The room was quiet. Through the shuttered window, the canal lapped at the building's foundation, that patient repetition. A neighbor's voice somewhere above, muffled by plaster and wood. Then nothing.

"Mirela?" she said.

"At the scuola."

She unwound the shawl from her hair. Folded it once and set it on the stool nearest the door. Her hair was pinned but loose at the temples where the damp had pulled it free, and the strand along her jaw — that strand, the one that never stayed — hung dark against her throat.

She had crossed the lagoon. A Christian woman, unmarried, the daughter of a Murano maestro, walking into the Jewish quarter at dusk. If anyone had seen her the cost would be hers to pay. Not his. He understood this. She understood that he understood it.

"You've been expelled," she said.

"Yes."

"Bardolino."

"Yes."

She did not ask what came next. She crossed the room to him the way she did everything — without hesitation, the decision already made before the body carried it out. Her hand came up to his face. Her palm against his jaw, the heel of her hand against his cheekbone, her fingers along his temple. The quill callus on her forefinger — that hard ridge built by years of recording her father's accounts — pressed against the skin below his ear.

He turned his head into her hand. Pressed his mouth to her palm. Her skin tasted of salt and the damp of the lagoon crossing and something faintly metallic, ink perhaps, dried on her fingers from the day's work. His lips found the callus at the base of her thumb where the counting beads had worn their groove, and he felt her fingers tighten against his face.

"Enzo."

He kissed her. Not the way he had in the boat shed, where the kiss had been a collision. Not the way he had in the counting room, where it had been slow and deliberate. This was something else. His mouth on hers and her hand still on his face and his hands at his sides because for a moment he could not make them move, everything that had happened holding them there, and then her other hand took his wrist and lifted his arm and placed his hand on her hip, and his body remembered.

Her fingers worked at the laces of her bodice. His helped. The laces loosened and the garment opened and she pushed it down off her shoulders and it fell to the floor. The shift beneath was thin, damp from the crossing. He could feel the warmth of her body through it and the shapes of her body, her breasts, the ladder of her ribs. She pulled the shift over her head.

The glass-bead necklace lay against her sternum. Eighteen beads on a silk cord, each one a different colour — amber, cobalt, a green so dark it was nearly black, a red like the inside of a furnace mouth, a pale blue, a gold, and others he could not name in this light. Each bead blown by her father's breath. One for each year of her life.

He pulled his shirt over his head. Her hands went to his chest. The skin where the yellow circle usually sat was paler than the rest, a ghost of the badge printed by years of sun falling on everything except what the cloth covered. In the boat shed she had traced the edge of it. In the counting room it had lain on the floor. Now there was nothing to trace. The pale circle was there but the badge was not, and her hands moved across his chest without stopping at any boundary.

They moved to the sleeping chamber. The pallet was narrow. He sat and she stood before him and unlaced her skirts and stepped out of them and she was bare except for the necklace, the beads catching the last thin light from the window. The freckles across her shoulders and collarbones. He knew them. He had pressed his lips to them in the dark of the boat shed and he knew them now the way his hands knew the grain of a ground surface, by touch and repetition, each one particular and placed.

She knelt on the pallet beside him. Her hands on his shoulders. He lay back and she followed, her weight settling over him, and the pallet creaked once and held.

His hands on her hips. Her knees on either side of him. The necklace hung forward from her throat and the beads grazed his chest, eighteen small cool points. She reached between them. Her fingers found him. She lowered herself onto him and the sound she made was quiet, almost nothing, a caught breath released through her nose.

They moved. Slowly. Her palms flat on his chest, his hands at her waist, the grinding calluses on his fingertips catching against the skin above her hip bones. The pallet shifted beneath them. No other sound. The house was empty. The house was theirs, for this hour, and the silence of it held them the way water holds a thing suspended — present on all sides, weightless, temporary.

She bent forward. Her forehead against his. Her breath on his mouth. He could see her eyes, open, hazel-green, close enough that the colour separated into its components the way light separates through a prism. Green near the centre. Brown at the edges. Gold where the last daylight caught.

Short breaths. His hands tightened on her waist. She pressed down against him and her body tightened and he felt it, the contraction, and her breath stopped and then released in a single low sound, private, not meant for anyone. He followed. His back arched off the pallet. His fingers dug into her hips hard enough to leave marks and he heard his own breathing, rough and ragged, and then it was done.

Stillness.

She stayed where she was. Her hands on his chest. His hands loose at her waist. Through the window the light had gone from grey to the deeper grey that comes before full dark. The canal sound continued. Somewhere in the building a timber settled with a groan that travelled through the walls and floor and up through the pallet and into both their bodies.

She lifted herself off him and lay beside him on the narrow pallet, her shoulder against his shoulder, her hip against his hip. The space was too small for distance between them. He could feel her breathing slow.

After a time she sat up. She did not dress. She sat with her legs folded beneath her and her hair fallen across one shoulder and reached behind her neck. Her fingers worked the clasp of the necklace. The silk cord came free. She held it in both hands.

Eighteen beads. He watched her turn them in her fingers, each one catching the dim light differently. Amber, cobalt, green, red, gold, pale blue, a violet so deep it was nearly brown, a clear bead that held the light without colour, and ten others, each one the work of a single breath through a gather of molten glass, each one shaped by her father's hands at a furnace that had burned for forty years on Murano.

She reached for his hand. Turned it over. Set the necklace in his palm and closed his fingers over it. The beads were warm from her skin. The cord lay across his calluses.

She did not explain. She looked at him once. That look — thorough, appraising, the look of a woman committing something to a ledger she would carry in her body rather than on paper.

Then she stood and dressed. The shift first, then the skirts, the laces pulled tight with practised hands. The bodice last. She pinned her hair where it had fallen. Her movements were efficient and unhurried, the same practical competence she brought to columns of figures, to the ordinary business of living in a world that did not often accommodate what she wanted.

She picked up her shawl from the stool. Wrapped it over her hair. She paused at the door. One hand on the latch.

"The beads are yours," she said. The first unnecessary words either of them had spoken.

He did not answer. She lifted the latch and went out, and her footsteps descended the stairs — one, two, three, the third step creaking as it always creaked — and then the lower door, and then nothing.

Enzo lay on the pallet with the necklace in his closed fist. The beads pressed into his palm, each one a small hard warmth. Eighteen. One for each year she had been alive, each one her father's work, blown from a gather he had turned on the end of a pipe at a furnace she had watched since she was old enough to stand. The cord trailed between his fingers and hung in the dark.

He sat up. Crossed to the main room. The workbench was there, as it always was, Giacomo's tools in their places, the dust undisturbed, the unfinished lens blank in its clamp. He set the necklace down on the bench, among the calipers and grinding forms and the chalk marks in his dead father's hand. The beads settled against the scored wood, each colour dimmed in the failing light but present, held, one small thing laid down beside another.

Through the shutters the canal spoke its one word over and over. The room darkened. The workbench held what it held — the tools of a man who had seen clearly and been killed for it, and now beside them a strand of coloured glass left by a woman who had crossed the water.

He stood there until the light was gone.
