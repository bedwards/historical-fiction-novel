The short-range test had proved the weapon real, and Bardolino had watched the proof of it burn through every comfortable lie he had built across the months of grinding and fitting and telling himself that theory and practice were separated by a distance no friar's mathematics could bridge. The wood had caught. The beam had held. And now they would try again at the distance that mattered, and he stood with the millefiori piece turning between his thumb and forefinger and told himself that the laws of optics did not change between twenty braccia and two hundred, that light was light, that what worked close would work far, and that the sick feeling in his gut was only the cold wind off the lagoon and nothing more.

The arsenal workers were already moving the target. Four of them carried the hull planking — good Istrian oak, the same thickness as a galley's waterline strakes — across the island's scrubgrass and mud to the far stakes, where they set it upright and braced it with rope and driftwood. At twenty braccia the target had seemed close enough to touch. At two hundred it was a pale rectangle against the grey-green water beyond, no larger than a man's hand held at arm's length, and the wind that crossed the distance between the array and the planking carried salt and the smell of turned earth and something else, something Bardolino could not name, that might have been the ordinary autumn smell of things ending.

Fra Giordano was already at the array, his white habit snapping in the gusts, his hands moving across the frame with the proprietary confidence of a man who believed that God had written the world in mathematics and that he, Giordano, had learned to read the hand. He called instructions to the workers adjusting the tracking pivot — a half-degree left, a quarter-degree elevation — and his voice carried across the flat island with the clarity of a bell, and Bardolino thought, as he had thought before, that the friar would have made a fine ship's captain, or a fine general, or a fine anything that required the absolute certainty that one was right.

The housing that Bardolino had built held the lenses in their calculated positions: each ground to its specified curvature, each seated in bronze rings that he had machined himself because he trusted no one else with the tolerances, each aligned along the optical axis that Giordano's drawings prescribed. He had checked every mount twice and then a third time because the first two checks had not quieted the part of his mind that whispered *if you build it well enough it will work and if it works they will use it and if they use it men will burn*. But he had built it well. That was the thing he could not escape. He had built it with the same care he brought to everything, because fifty-seven years of glasswork had made precision not a choice but a reflex, something his hands did whether his conscience consented or not.

Viaro stood apart, upwind, his dark silk doublet buttoned to the throat against the cold. He had said nothing since the short-range test except to ask how long the realignment would take. His face was composed in that particular stillness that Bardolino had learned to read over the months of their association — not calm but controlled, the way a furnace door is controlled, holding back heat that would consume whatever stood too close. The scar along his jaw was a white line in the autumn light. His gold ring caught the sun when he moved his hand, which was seldom.

"The alignment is set," Fra Giordano called. "Master Bardolino, if you would confirm the housing."

Bardolino walked to the array. His right knee ached with each step — the cold made it worse, always had, and he was too old to pretend otherwise — and he bent to examine the housing mounts with the careful attention of a man who knows that his examination is being watched and that the watchers will remember what he said. The bronze rings were seated. The lenses were clean. The alignment marks he had scribed into the frame matched their reference points within a hair's width.

"The housing is true," he said, and his voice was steady, which surprised him, because his hands were not.

Giordano nodded. He pulled the cover from the primary collector lens, and the autumn sun — lower now than it had been for the first test, but still strong enough, still carrying the late-morning heat that this time of year sometimes held like a gift or a taunt — struck the array and entered the system.

Bardolino watched the light move through the lenses. He knew what it should do. He had seen it do exactly that at twenty braccia: the broad disc of collected sunlight narrowing, concentrating, tightening into that terrible bright point that had made the wood smoke and then char and then catch. The geometry was the same. The glass was the same. The housing was the same.

But the island was longer than the geometry, and two hundred braccia was not twenty, and when Bardolino shielded his eyes and looked toward the distant target he saw not a point but a disc — a bright circle of light on the hull planking, perhaps a braccio across, shimmering in the wind-moved air like a reflection thrown from a hand mirror onto a far wall. Bright. Warm, perhaps. But diffuse. Spread. The concentrated fury of the short-range test had opened like a fist unclenching, and what reached the target was not fire but only light.

They waited. Giordano's calculations had predicted ignition within thirty seconds at deployment range. Thirty seconds passed. A minute. The bright disc wavered on the planking. The wood did not smoke. The wood did not char. The wood did not burn.

Bardolino heard Fra Giordano make a sound — not a word, not a curse, something lower and more private, the sound of a man whose faith has been tested by the God he thought he was serving. And then the friar was moving, his white habit a banner of fury, stalking from the array toward the target with his chalk still in his hand and his calculations still in his head and his voice rising in a torrent of accusation that was aimed at everything except himself.

"The glass," Giordano said. "The curvature is wrong. The indices are inconsistent. I specified crown glass of a particular composition and what I received was — show me the lenses, let me see every lens, I will measure them myself — the focal lengths are not what I calculated, they cannot be, or the convergence would hold at distance —"

He was pulling at the housing now, and Bardolino stepped forward to stop him because the friar's hands were shaking and the lenses were worth more than anything else on this island, and Bardolino said, "The lenses were ground to your specifications, Fra Giordano, every one of them, I checked —"

"Then the housing. The spacing. A deviation of half a hair's breadth at the primary would spread the beam by —" Giordano was already calculating, his chalk out, writing figures on the flat wooden base of the array as though the world were a slate that could be corrected with better arithmetic. "The tolerances, Bardolino. Your tolerances."

"My tolerances are exact."

"Then explain to me why my mathematics fail."

It was not a question. It was an indictment, and Bardolino felt it land the way a glassblower feels a crack propagate through a cooling vessel — sudden, irreversible, the sound of something that cannot be repaired. He opened his mouth to answer and found that he had no answer, because the housing *was* exact and the lenses *were* ground to specification and the mathematics, as far as he could follow them, *were* sound, and yet the wood had not burned, and he did not know why.

Viaro's voice came from behind them, and it was quiet, and the quiet was worse than Giordano's shouting the way a closed furnace is worse than an open flame, because the heat has nowhere to go.

"Can it be corrected?"

Four words. Bardolino turned to face him. Viaro's expression had not changed. His hands were clasped behind his back. The gold ring was hidden. The scar was white. And Bardolino understood, with the clarity that fear sometimes brings to a slow mind, that Viaro was not asking about optics. He was asking whether the Council's investment — the money, the time, the political capital spent on a weapon that had just failed to perform its single function — could be salvaged, and if it could not, he was asking who would bear the cost of that failure, and his eyes moved from Giordano to Bardolino and rested there.

"The theory is sound," Giordano said, and his voice had changed, the fury banking down into something harder and more dangerous. "The theory is *proven*. At twenty braccia —"

"At twenty braccia," Viaro said, "we burned a target that a man with a torch could have reached on foot. I did not arrange this demonstration for twenty braccia."

The silence that followed was not empty. It was full of calculations — Giordano's, mathematical; Viaro's, political; and Bardolino's, which were the calculations of a man with a furnace and a name and a family and a reputation that had taken thirty years to build and could be dismantled in an afternoon by a single report to the Council of Ten. He had built the housing. His mark was on the bronze. If the weapon had failed because of the housing, then the failure was his, and what the Council did with failure Bardolino did not wish to contemplate, because the contemplation led to places — the Leads, the Wells, the quiet disappearances that Venice accomplished with such administrative efficiency — that made his bad knee ache and his missing fingertip throb with phantom pain.

But part of him — and this was the part he could not look at directly, the way one cannot look directly into a furnace at full heat — part of him was relieved. The weapon had not worked. At the distance that mattered, at the distance between a shore battery and a ship's hull, the beam spread and the fire did not come, and the sailors who would have burned did not burn, and the galleys that would have become pyres remained, for now, only galleys. He had not wanted the weapon to work. He had told himself it would not work. And it had not worked, and the relief was real, and the relief was immediately swallowed by the understanding that relief was a luxury he could not afford, because the failure had his name on it.

He looked across the island, past Giordano who was still scrawling figures on the wooden base, past Viaro who was watching them both with the patience of a man who knows that patience is its own form of pressure, and he saw Enzo.

The boy stood at the edge of the group, near the water, where the autumn wind pulled at his hair and pressed his doublet flat against his chest. The yellow circle sewn there was bright — brighter than it should have been, Bardolino thought, in the low gold light of the declining morning, as though the cloth had been cut from the sun itself and stitched there as a mark that said *I am other, I am apart, I am the thing you see but do not say*. Enzo's hands were at his sides. His face was still. Not afraid, not relieved, not anything that Bardolino could name, and Bardolino had known the boy for six years and had learned to read his expressions the way he read a melt — by color, by consistency, by the small signs that told you what was happening beneath the surface.

The boy looked like a man who had already known.

The thought arrived and Bardolino turned from it. He turned from it the way he would turn from a heat crack in a finished piece — not denying it, not examining it, simply setting the piece aside and reaching for the next one, because to follow the crack would be to see where it led, and where it led was a place that would require him to act, and he could not act, and so he could not look.

He turned away.

They packed the equipment in silence. The arsenal workers dismantled the array and wrapped the lenses in oiled cloth and laid them in their cases with the care of men handling relics, which in a sense they were — relics of a theory that had burned bright at twenty braccia and gone dark at two hundred. The hull planking was left on its stakes. No one suggested bringing it back. It was unmarked, unburned, ordinary wood, and it would stand there until the winter storms took it or the salt air rotted it, whichever came first.

The boats were loaded. Bardolino climbed into the stern of the second craft — carefully, because the knee would not bend without warning him — and settled onto the thwart and felt the millefiori piece in his pocket press against his thigh. He took it out and held it. The colored glass caught the autumn light: the tiny flowers, red and white and blue, frozen in their crystal matrix, each one perfect, each one exactly where it had been placed, the whole thing a small proof that precision was possible, that a man could make something beautiful and have it stay beautiful and not be called upon to answer for it.

Enzo took the forward oars. He rowed with the steady, unhurried stroke of a young man who had grown up on the water, and his back was to Bardolino, and Bardolino watched that back — the shoulders, the yellow circle, the grinding calluses on the hands that gripped the oar handles — and thought of Giacomo Sforno, who had died in the furnace explosion that had cost the boy his father, and of the promise Bardolino had made to himself afterward, not to Giacomo, who was beyond promises, but to himself, that he would look after the son because he had not been able to save the father.

The lagoon was gold. The autumn light lay on the water like something poured from a crucible — molten, heavy, beautiful in the way that beautiful things are beautiful when you suspect you are seeing them for the last time, or the first time, which are sometimes the same. The oars dipped and rose. The boat moved toward Murano, toward the furnaces, toward whatever came next, and Bardolino held the millefiori piece and watched the boy's back and understood, without quite allowing himself to think it, that something had ended on that island, or something had begun, and that he did not know which, and that not knowing was perhaps the last mercy left to him.
