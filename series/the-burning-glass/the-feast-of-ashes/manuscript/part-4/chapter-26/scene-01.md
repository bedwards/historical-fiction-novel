He should not have watched. But a man who builds a thing must see what becomes of it, the way a father must attend the christening even when he suspects the child will grow into a monster. Bardolino stood on the mudflat with his boots sinking into silt that smelled of low tide and rot, and he watched the arsenal workers unload the last of the crates from the barge, and he told himself that the morning air was good for his knee.

The island had no name that he knew. A strip of land too flat and too exposed for anything but waterfowl and the coarse grass that grew in salt marshes, bending always in the same direction, as if the wind had long ago won an argument that the grass no longer bothered to contest. To the north, the campanile of Torcello rose above the haze like a finger held up in warning. To the south and west, the lagoon stretched grey and featureless under an autumn sky that could not decide between cloud and clarity — the sun appearing and vanishing at intervals, as though it too were reluctant to commit to what was about to happen.

They had crossed before dawn, four boats in the dark, and the silence of the crossing had suited Bardolino because silence allowed him to tend the small garden of lies he had been cultivating for two years. The weapon would not work. The mathematics were elegant but the materials were insufficient. Glass was not diamond, and Murano crystal, for all its clarity, would scatter the light rather than bind it. He had told himself these things so often and with such care that they had taken on the weight of conviction, and conviction, he had learned, was the most dangerous form of hope — because it felt like knowledge.

Now the crates were open, and the arsenal men were assembling the frame under Fra Giordano's direction, and the frame was beautiful.

He hated that it was beautiful. He had spent eleven weeks on the housing — the brass channeling, the pivot mechanism, the wheeled mount with its tracking arc scored in degrees along the base plate. It was the finest metalwork he had ever produced, finer than the reliquary he had made for the Basilica di San Marco in the year of his wife's death, finer than the filigree astrolabe that the Doge's nephew had commissioned and never paid for. The pivot turned on bearings he had ground himself, smooth as a knuckle in its socket. The mirror cradles were seated in gimbals that allowed adjustment to the width of a hair. Every joint was tight. Every surface was true.

A cracked pot leaks before it breaks, his father had said, and Bardolino had spent two years praying for cracks that never came.

Fra Giordano was moving among the apparatus like a white bird among reeds, his Dominican habit catching the marsh wind, his sleeves pushed back to the elbow as they always were when he worked. He was speaking to one of the arsenal men — a thick Castellano who handled the mirror plates with the exaggerated care of a man who has been told that what he carries is worth more than his life. Fra Giordano's hands sculpted the air as he explained the alignment sequence, his Latin slipping into Venetian and back again without apparent awareness, and his face held the particular radiance of a man who has lived for years inside an equation and is about to see it breathe.

Bardolino's hand found the millefiori piece in his pocket. He turned it between his finger and thumb — the one with the missing tip, so that the glass sat oddly in his grip, a small discomfort he had long since stopped noticing except at moments like this, when his body needed something to do that was not shaking.

"The short-range alignment first," Viaro said, from somewhere to Bardolino's left. He did not need to raise his voice. Viaro never raised his voice, in the same way that a blade never needs to announce itself before it cuts. He stood on a low hummock of dry ground, his dark silk doublet buttoned to the throat despite the chill, his hands clasped behind his back in the posture of a man reviewing troops. The jaw scar, livid in the cold air, pulled his mouth into something that was not quite a smile and not quite anything else. The scent of ambergris reached Bardolino even over the mud and the salt. "Twenty braccia. The oak plank."

The arsenal men set the target — a section of oak, the thickness of a ship's hull planking, propped upright on stakes driven into the soft ground. Twenty braccia from the device. Bardolino measured the distance with his eye and found it laughably short, the kind of distance across which a man could shout and be heard without effort, and he seized on this — the range was nothing, a demonstration for children, it proved nothing about the weapon's capacity at any meaningful distance — and then he recognized what he was doing, which was tending the garden again, pulling weeds that were not weeds but the last honest flowers.

The sun emerged.

Fra Giordano made a small sound — not a word, something more primal, the intake of breath that precedes revelation — and he gestured to the arsenal man at the tracking pivot. The man turned the wheel. The mirror array shifted, tilting in its gimbals, and the lenses caught the light.

What happened next took less time than it takes to say a Paternoster. The array focused the autumn sunlight through the sequence of lenses — primary, secondary, tertiary, each one bending and narrowing the beam according to the geometry that Fra Giordano had calculated on sheaves of paper that Bardolino had seen stacked in the friar's cell like scripture awaiting illumination — and the beam converged to a point on the oak plank, a point no wider than a man's fingernail, and the point was brighter than anything Bardolino had ever seen outside a furnace mouth.

The oak darkened. A wisp of smoke rose, thin and pale, almost indistinguishable from the marsh mist. Then the smoke thickened, turned brown, and a tongue of flame licked upward from the surface of the wood, and the flame caught and held and spread, and the plank was burning.

The plank was burning at twenty braccia from a device powered by nothing but the autumn sun.

Bardolino's stomach turned. He pressed the millefiori piece so hard into the pad of his thumb that he felt the glass flowers imprint themselves on his skin, tiny gardens of color pressed into flesh, and the nausea rose in him the way it had risen on the morning he learned that Giacomo Sforno was dead — that same sick understanding that a thing which should not have happened had happened, and that his own hands were somewhere in the chain of causes.

"Convergence ratio," Fra Giordano was saying, his voice high and quick with a joy that was terrible to hear because it was so genuine. "The convergence ratio is within two degrees of the theoretical prediction — do you see, Signore Viaro, do you see — the secondary lens corrects for the chromatic dispersion exactly as I calculated, exactly, and the tertiary — oh, this is God's geometry made manifest, this is the proof that the divine order extends to the behavior of light itself, that the Lord has written His laws in glass and fire and —"

"I see," Viaro said. "And at fifty braccia?"

"We must test," Fra Giordano said, already moving toward the apparatus, his sandals dark with mud, his face incandescent. "We must test at every interval. The Council will want data, yes, distances and times and materials — we should try sailcloth, and pitch-treated wood, and —"

"All of which has been arranged." Viaro turned to the arsenal men. "The second target. Fifty braccia."

Bardolino stood where he was while the men drove new stakes farther out along the mudflat. He watched the first plank burn. The fire had caught fully now, and the oak was splitting along its grain with small reports like knuckles cracking, and the smoke bent eastward in the wind, and he thought: I made the housing. The pivot is mine. The gimbals are mine. Every surface is true.

He had told himself the weapon would never work. He had believed it with the particular fervor of a man who needed to believe it, the way a gambler believes he will win back his losses, the way a drunkard believes he will stop tomorrow. The belief had been his shield, his absolution in advance, the document of pardon he had written for himself in an ink that was now revealed to be water. The fire was burning his lie along with the oak, and underneath the lie there was nothing — no second defense, no deeper justification, only the bare and miserable fact that Vittorio Bardolino, master glassmaker of Murano, had built a weapon of war and had built it well.

He looked for the boy.

Enzo stood apart from the others, closer to the water's edge, where the mudflat gave way to shallow brine and the reeds grew thick. He was watching the burning plank with an expression that Bardolino could not read — not horror, not fascination, not the ecstasy of Fra Giordano or the cold satisfaction of Viaro, but something else, something closed and still, like a door pulled shut from the inside. The yellow circle on his doublet was bright against the grey morning. His hands hung at his sides, and Bardolino noticed that they were steady — no tremor, no clenching, just the calloused hands of a grinder at rest. He was eighteen years old, and he had his father's way of standing very still when the world required an answer he was not yet ready to give.

Bardolino wanted to know what the boy was thinking. He wanted to cross the mudflat and stand beside him and ask, plainly, as one man to another: What do you see? But he could not do this, because to ask the question would be to admit that he himself did not know the answer, and to admit that would be to confess that the weapon's success had undone something in him that he did not know how to repair. And so he stood where he was, an old man with a bad knee and a missing fingertip and a piece of millefiori glass pressed into the meat of his hand, and he watched the smoke rise from the burning plank, and he said nothing.

The sun went behind a cloud. The beam died. The plank continued to burn on its own.

"Fifty braccia," Viaro said, to no one in particular, in the tone of a man who has tasted a dish and found it acceptable and is now ready for the next course.

The arsenal men were already moving the apparatus forward along the scored track of the wheeled mount, and Fra Giordano was already recalculating, his lips moving in silent arithmetic, his mud-dark sandals leaving prints in the silt like the tracks of some wading bird that has not yet learned to fear the hunter. And Bardolino stood in the smoke of the first test and breathed it in — the smell of burned oak, which was not so different from the smell of a furnace, which was not so different from the smell of a world in which he could no longer pretend that the fire would not do what fire has always done.
