They walked north along the fondamenta, and the sky was doing what it did on evenings when the tramontana had scoured the air clean — turning the color of Murano's own glass, that pale blue-green the old masters called acquamarina, shot through now with bands of copper and gold where the sun had gone down behind the churches of Venice. The furnace chimneys still trailed their smoke, but thinner at this hour, the fires banked for the night shift, and the smoke lay against that sky like veins in marble.

Enzo kept half a pace between them. Not enough to seem deliberate. Enough to keep his sleeve from brushing hers.

"Your father's cristallo," he said, because they had been talking about her father's glass and it was safer to keep talking about it than to stop. "The clarity is better than anything Bardolino produces. I've held a piece up to a candle. No color at all."

"He purifies the quartz three times." She said it the way she said everything about her father's craft — with a precision that was also pride, also love, also something she would never have called by any of those names. "Most maestri do it twice and call it sufficient. He says twice is for men who want to be adequate."

"Bardolino purifies twice."

"I know."

A boat passed on the canal, low in the water, loaded with firewood for the furnaces. The boatman's oar creaked in its lock. Enzo watched the wake spread and flatten against the stone of the fondamenta, the water dark now, holding the orange glow of the nearest furnace the way glass holds color — not on its surface but somewhere inside, somewhere you could not quite reach.

"There's a problem we've been having," he said. He did not know why he was telling her this. He knew exactly why he was telling her this. "With the enamel work. Bardolino wants to fuse colored enamel onto cristallo vessels — layer the color on after the form is blown, fire it in a second heating. The colors are good. The cristallo is good. But they won't hold to each other."

Serena's step slowed. He could feel her thinking — the same focused attention she had given the account books, turned now to a problem of materials. A strand of dark auburn hair had loosened from her braid and lay against her neck. He looked at the canal.

"What temperature on the second firing?"

"Hot enough to soften the enamel. Not so hot that the vessel deforms."

"And the enamel cracks off."

"Or the cristallo cracks under it. One or the other. Always."

She was quiet for several paces. Their footsteps sounded on the stone — his heavier, in the rough-soled shoes apprentices wore; hers lighter, in leather that fit. A woman coming toward them on the fondamenta glanced at Enzo, and her gaze caught on the yellow circle stitched to his doublet, and she looked away. He had stopped noticing that look years ago. He noticed it now because Serena was beside him, and noticing it through the imagined frame of her attention made it new again, made it a thing with edges.

"The coefficients are wrong," Serena said.

He looked at her.

"When glass cools, it contracts," she said. "You know this. But different glasses contract at different rates. Cristallo contracts one way. The enamel contracts another. If the rates don't match — if one pulls harder than the other as they cool —"

"They tear apart."

"They tear apart. It doesn't matter how hot the fire is or how clean the fusion looks when it's molten. In the heat, everything is compatible. Everything flows together. It's in the cooling that the truth comes out." She paused. The dimple in her left cheek appeared and vanished — not a smile, exactly, but the shape of something she had chosen not to say. "You could have the most beautiful join in the world at temperature. Perfect adhesion. The two materials flowing into each other as if they were one substance. But if their natures pull them different ways when the fire goes out —"

She stopped. They both stopped, there on the fondamenta, with the canal water lapping at the stone below and the sky nearly dark and a furnace still sending its glow across the water in a wavering line of orange that broke and re-formed and broke again.

"So there's no solution," Enzo said. His voice was even. His thumb moved across the roughened tips of his left fingers, back and forth, the calluses from grinding catching against each other.

"I didn't say that." She turned to face him, and in the furnace light her eyes held the color they always held in this particular quality of dusk — not quite green, not quite brown, the hazel shifting depending on what light touched it. He thought of the way certain metals changed color in glass depending on whether the atmosphere in the furnace was oxidizing or reducing. The same substance, transformed by its conditions. "You'd need to change the composition of the enamel. Adjust its nature so that it contracts at the same rate as the cristallo. Make them — compatible. At the level of what they are."

"Can that be done?"

"My father has done it. For simple enamels, the common colors — red, blue, white. But for the difficult ones? The ones that require gold or silver in the compound?" She shook her head. "The noble metals resist. They have their own nature and they don't yield it. You can't make gold behave like common silica. It remains what it is."

The fondamenta was nearly empty now. The workers had gone home to their suppers. Somewhere behind them a door closed, and the sound carried across the water with the clarity that still air gives to small noises at dusk. Enzo could smell the canal — salt and weed and the mineral tang of wet stone — and beneath it, always, the furnace smell, the smell of Murano itself, ash and sand and the faintest bite of sulfur.

"There's another approach," he said. He said it quietly, not looking at her, looking at the canal where the furnace light still made its broken line. "You don't try to change either material. You put a third substance between them. A mediating layer. Something whose coefficient sits between the two — that bonds to both because its nature is partly one, partly the other."

"A go-between glass."

"Yes."

"And does it work?"

He almost smiled. "I don't know. I've read about it. In a book that belonged to a man who belonged to a tradition that keeps very careful records." He meant a Jewish glassmaker's notebook — one of the volumes his father had, written in Hebrew, recording techniques the Murano guilds did not possess and did not know they lacked. He would not say more than that. She would hear what he meant.

She heard. Her hand moved at her side — he saw it from the edge of his vision, the fingers opening and almost extending toward him before they closed again and were still. The glass bead necklace at her throat caught the furnace light. Each bead was a different color, a different technique. Her father had made them, one a year, since she was small. She wore his whole career around her neck.

"A third substance," she said. "That belongs to both and neither."

"Yes."

"That would have to be very precisely made."

"It would."

They stood there. The water moved against the stone. Above them the sky had gone from acquamarina to something deeper — the blue-black of Murano glass colored with cobalt, the kind of dark that still holds light somewhere inside it. The furnace glow was the only warmth left in the air, and it was not enough.

She looked at the yellow circle on his doublet. She did not look away from it as the woman on the fondamenta had. She looked at it steadily, her gaze resting on it the way a glassmaker's gaze rests on a gather — reading its temperature, its viscosity, its readiness, all the things the material is saying if you know how to listen. Then she looked up at his face.

Neither of them spoke. The space where words would go was not empty. It was full the way a finished vessel is full — shaped by what it contains, which is air, which is nothing, which is the whole point.

"I should go back," she said. "Before anyone marks the time."

"Yes."

"The fondamenta splits up ahead. You'll go left for the traghetto?"

"Yes."

They walked the last thirty paces to where the stone path forked — right toward the Contarini furnace and the houses of the masters, left toward the landing where the ferry crossed to the Ghetto Nuovo. They reached it and stopped, and the distance between them was the same half pace it had been for the entire walk, and it was the width of the lagoon.

"Goodnight, Enzo."

"Goodnight."

She turned and walked north along the right-hand fondamenta, her step quick and sure on the stone, the loose strand of hair dark against her neck. He watched her go. The glass beads at her throat caught the light once more as she passed the last lit furnace, and then she was past it, and the beads went dark, and she was a shape against the deeper dark, and then she was the dark.

He turned left. The water of the canal held the furnace glow a moment longer, a line of orange on black, trembling with each small movement of the tide. Then the angle changed, and that was gone too, and there was only the stone under his feet, and the salt smell, and the long walk home across the water to the place where he was kept.
