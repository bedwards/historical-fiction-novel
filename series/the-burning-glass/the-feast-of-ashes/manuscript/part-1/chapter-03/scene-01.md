The canal threw back the morning in white pieces. Enzo walked the Fondamenta with the leather pouch empty at his hip, Bardolino's instructions precise for once — Contarini's grinding compound, the fine grade, enough for three days. The old man had not said please. He had said *now*.

Smoke rose from every chimney on the Fondamenta dei Vetrai, and the columns leaned east where the breeze took them and merged into a single gray wash above the rooftops. A barge sat low in the canal, its deck stacked with beechwood billets, and two men argued over the count while a third sat on a coil of rope and ate bread. Enzo passed the Barovier furnace, its doors open, the heat reaching him six paces out. Past the Ballarin workshop, shuttered still — old Ballarin had been sick since Lent, people said, though others said drunk. Past the stone wellhead where an apprentice younger than Enzo hauled water with both hands on the rope, his face red and furious with effort.

He knew this street the way his tongue knew his teeth. Every furnace had a sound. Barovier's roared low and steady, a furnace fed well and fed often. The smaller houses coughed and spat, their fires banked too thin. Between the furnaces, other sounds — the scrape of a pontil on stone, the tap of a jack against a blowpipe's neck, and beneath it all the canal working its slow mouth against the fondamenta walls.

The Contarini furnace stood four doors past the turning. Enzo saw the difference before he reached the threshold. The brickwork was newer, the mortar lines clean and pale where Bardolino's had gone dark with decades of soot that no one scraped. The doors were oak, not pine. The hinges did not sing.

He stepped inside. The main floor was quiet — the morning melt not yet poured, the crucibles still sealed. Two men worked near the annealing oven, moving with the unhurried ease of workers who were not afraid. That was the thing he noticed. The absence of haste. At Bardolino's, everything moved faster than it should, as though speed could substitute for what was missing. Here the air itself seemed patient.

A door stood open at the far wall. Through it he could see a table, papers, a window that let in canal light. A figure sat behind the table with a pen in her hand and a ledger open before her.

Serena looked up.

Her hair was braided and pinned, but strands had pulled free at her temples the way they always did, the dark auburn catching the window light and holding it. Freckles across the bridge of her nose and her cheeks. Her sleeves were pushed to her elbows, and her right hand had ink on the third finger where the pen rested.

"Enzo Sforno," she said. Not a question. She set the pen in its groove and sat back. "You look older."

"Eight months will do that."

"Eight months and a commission, I hear." The dimple in her left cheek appeared and vanished. "The Morosini mirror. Word travels on this street like fire travels through pine."

He had not expected her to know. He stood in the doorway with the empty pouch in his hand and felt the distance of the months between them — not a quarrel, nothing so definite. Just the slow withdrawal of two lives into their separate work.

"Bardolino sent me for grinding compound," he said. "The fine grade."

"I know where it is." She did not move to get it. "Sit down. You're making the doorway look narrow."

He sat. The chair was good — solid wood, no wobble. Even the furniture here was better.

"Cristallo for a patrician mirror," Serena said. She pulled a second ledger from beneath the first and opened it, running her finger down a column. "Do you know what Morosini is paying?"

"Bardolino hasn't told me."

"He wouldn't. But the last cristallo commission of that size — the Gradenigo order, two years ago — went for eighteen ducats. Morosini will pay twenty at least. The wedding is political. A Morosini daughter marrying into the Priuli. They will want the mirror flawless, and they will pay for the wanting."

Enzo watched her finger move across the numbers. Her hands were calloused at the palms and the base of the fingers — not a gentlewoman's hands, not a glassblower's either. The hands of someone who carried things, moved things, kept the machinery of a furnace turning beneath the level where men noticed.

"You keep all the accounts," he said.

"Someone has to. My father can read a crucible at forty paces but give him a column of figures and he goes blind." She closed the ledger. "The compound you want — we buy it from a man in Chioggia. Silica flour mixed with calciumite, ground twice. My father pays three soldi a pound but he could get it for two if he bought in quantity. He won't, because he doesn't trust the quality in bulk. He's right not to. The last bulk shipment hadite ground from river sand, not sea sand. You can taste the difference in the polish."

She said this the way Enzo might describe the behavior of light through cristallo — plainly, because the knowledge was plain to her, part of the ordinary furniture of her mind. He had known Serena since he was eleven, when Giacomo had brought him to this furnace to watch a goblet pulled. She had been ten and had told him, with great authority, that he was standing too close to the glory hole. She had been right.

"You know more about the business side than I do," he said.

"I know more about the business side than most of the men on this street. But I don't hold a blowpipe, so it doesn't signify." Her voice was dry and level. She reached for the pen, turned it between her fingers, set it down. "How is the grinding going? For the mirror."

"Slow. The blank has an inclusion I can't work around. I'll need to pour another."

"Use Bardolino's second crucible. The first runs cold on the left side — everyone knows it, and no one fixes it because fixing it costs money Bardolino doesn't have."

Before Enzo could answer, a voice came from the main floor — broad, warm, carrying the way a big man's voice carries through a space he owns.

"Is that the Sforno boy?"

Maestro Contarini filled the doorway. He was thick through the chest and arms, his leather apron scarred and shining with old burns. His face was red from the furnace, and his eyes, small and sharp in that wide face, settled on Enzo with an expression that held both pleasure and something more careful beneath it.

"Stand up, let me look at you." Enzo stood. Contarini took his hands and turned them over, examining the palms, the calluses, the fine burn marks across the knuckles. "Your father's hands in a younger body," he said. "Giacomo had the same pattern — the wear on the right thumb, here. From the grinding wheel."

Enzo's throat tightened. He looked at his own hands in the maestro's grip and saw what Contarini saw — the ghost of his father's work written in the same places on the same skin.

"He'd be proud of the Morosini commission," Contarini said. He released Enzo's hands and clapped him on the shoulder. "Tell Bardolino I'll send the compound over with my boy this afternoon. No charge. For Giacomo's sake." He turned to Serena. "Don't keep him too long. Bardolino counts minutes the way I count ducats."

Then he was gone, back to the floor, his voice already rising over some question about the melt.

Enzo sat down again. He should go. Tomaso would be watching for his return, measuring the minutes, looking for evidence of disloyalty or sloth. The leather pouch sat empty in his lap. He had what he came for — the promise of the compound, a better answer than carrying it himself.

Serena was watching him. Her hazel eyes, green in the canal light from the window, held nothing he could name — only a kind of steadiness, an attention that did not slide away or soften into something easier.

"Tell me about the inclusion," she said. "In the blank."

So he told her. He described the flaw — a thread of air trapped in the cristallo, thin as a hair, curving like a river seen from a tower. He described how light broke around it, split and scattered instead of passing clean. And she listened the way no one at Bardolino's listened, with her whole face, asking questions that cut to the center of the problem. Could he grind past it? No, it ran too deep. Could he incorporate it? Not for a Morosini mirror. So a new pour, and the old blank was wasted time.

"Not wasted," Serena said. "You learned where the flaw sits. That's worth three days."

The morning had moved while they spoke. The light from the window had shifted, the canal sounds changing as the tide turned and the barges began to move. He had stayed too long. He knew this, and he stayed another minute, and then another, because Serena Contarini saw the flaw in his work and called it knowledge, and the seeing was a kind of heat that had nothing to do with any furnace — clean and steady and precise.

He stood. He thanked her. She picked up her pen.

"Come back when you pour the new blank," she said. "I want to know if the second crucible runs true."

He walked out through the calm floor of the Contarini furnace, past the men who worked without haste, into the smoke and noise of the Fondamenta. The leather pouch was still empty at his hip. The compound would come later. What he carried back was not something that fit in a pouch.

The morning light on the canal was white and hard and good.
