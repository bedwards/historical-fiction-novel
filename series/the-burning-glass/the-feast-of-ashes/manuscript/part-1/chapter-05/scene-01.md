The ledger's columns refused to reconcile, and Bardolino pressed his thumb against the inkstained margin as though he could force the figures into obedience by touch alone. Three hundred and twelve ducats owed to the wood suppliers in Cadore. Forty-seven to the soda ash merchant in Levante, who had already sent his factor twice to inquire after payment and whose patience, like his product, had a finite alkalinity before it turned corrosive. Eighteen ducats for the new crucible clay from Vicenza — inferior stuff, chalky and prone to fracture above a certain heat, but he could no longer afford the Istrian grade his father had insisted upon, back when his father still possessed the judgment to insist upon anything at all.

His right hand moved to his pocket. The millefiori piece was there, warm from his body, its surface worn to a gloss that no polishing wheel could have achieved — only years of handling, years of fingers finding it in the dark of a coat or the lining of an apron. He had made it at nineteen, a small disc no wider than his thumbnail, the cane slices arranged in a pattern of red and blue and gold that he had thought, at the time, captured something essential about the art. About what glass could be when it was not debased by commerce. He rolled it between finger and thumb now, and its smoothness was the smoothness of a lie he had been telling himself for thirty-six years: that the work mattered more than the money. That beauty was its own solvency.

Across the desk, the Morosini commission papers lay open beside the general accounts, and the contrast between them was the contrast between a cup of canal water and the canal itself. Morosini wanted forty drinking vessels, gilt-rimmed, with the family crest in lattimo — respectable work, the kind of order that kept apprentices fed and gave a furnace the appearance of health. Eighty ducats. He would see perhaps thirty of clear profit after materials and labor, and thirty ducats would purchase exactly enough beechwood to feed the furnace for five weeks if he banked the fires low and ran only a single crucible through the night shifts. Five weeks. The soda ash merchant would not wait five weeks.

Bardolino closed the Morosini ledger and sat with his hands flat on the desk, feeling the residual warmth that rose through the walnut from the furnace floor below, a heat so constant and so familiar that he noticed it only in its variations — cooler now, the fires banked for the night, the apprentices gone to their beds in the dormitory across the calle. The building settled around him with the particular sighs and ticks of cooling masonry, and through the cracks in the floorboards a faint orange light breathed upward like the memory of the day's work.

He unlocked the cabinet.

The leather pouch sat on top of Fra Giordano's diagrams, and he drew it out and set it on the desk beside the open accounts. Thirty gold ducats. Counted already, twice, but he loosened the drawstring and let three of them slide onto the wood because the sound they made — that particular dense kiss of gold on walnut — was a sound that answered questions the ledger could only ask. Thirty ducats for the latest twelve lenses, delivered to the courier at the agreed hour, wrapped in oiled linen and packed in straw as though they were eggs from some monstrous geometric bird. The courier never gave his name. He arrived by gondola, black felze drawn, and departed the same way, and the pouch appeared on the workshop doorstep before dawn, placed there by hands Bardolino had trained himself not to imagine belonging to any particular body.

Fifty lenses in total. Twenty mirrors. Ten prisms. Fra Giordano's specifications were meticulous to the point of obsession — curvatures expressed in Euclidean ratios, surface tolerances that pushed the cristallo to its material limits, focal lengths calculated with a precision that Bardolino had encountered in no other patron in forty years of glassmaking. Thirty-eight of the fifty lenses were complete. The mirrors presented fewer difficulties. The prisms he had not yet begun, but the grinding would be straightforward once he committed a form to the work.

At the current rate of payment, the full commission would yield three hundred and seventy ducats above what he had already received. Enough to clear every debt in the ledger. Enough to purchase a year's supply of Istrian clay. Enough to repair the second furnace, which had stood cold since the autumn when the firebricks cracked and he could not afford to replace them. Three hundred and seventy ducats was not wealth; it was the precise distance between survival and ruin, and Viaro's commission was a bridge across it, and if the bridge was built over questionable waters, well — a man who was drowning did not interrogate the carpenter.

He turned the millefiori piece again. His missing fingertip — lost to a pontil rod at twenty-three, a clumsy error he would have beaten an apprentice for — rubbed against his thumb in the old unconscious rhythm.

The boy's face.

That was what would not leave him, what had followed him up the stairs and through his supper of bread and hard cheese and watered wine and into this chair behind this desk. Enzo's face when he came out of the storeroom. Not frightened, not defiant, not even particularly surprised. Calm. The particular calm of a mind that had received information and was holding it at a careful distance, turning it as a lens grinder turns a blank — examining it from every angle before committing to the first cut.

Bardolino knew that calm. He had watched it settle over Giacomo Sforno's features a hundred times in the years they worked side by side, Giacomo at his grinding bench and Bardolino at his furnace, two men who understood glass from opposite ends of its life — one who made it, one who shaped it after making. Giacomo's calm had been the most dangerous thing about him. Other men shouted when they were angry, wept when they were grieved, stammered when they were afraid. Giacomo went quiet. Giacomo went precise. And then, days or weeks later, Giacomo acted, and his actions had the quality of glass itself — transparent, inevitable, and very nearly impossible to reverse once set.

The boy had his father's hands. Long-fingered, steady, the tendons visible beneath the skin when he gripped the grinding handle. He had his father's way of tilting his head when he listened, as though sound entered him asymmetrically and required correction. And today, coming out of that storeroom with the daylight catching the fine dust on his sleeves, he had his father's stillness.

Bardolino could confide in him. The thought arrived with the false warmth of good intentions — bring the boy in, explain the commission, make him understand that the components were merely glass, that glass was innocent of its uses, that a lens did not choose what it magnified or what it burned. Enzo was gifted enough to appreciate the technical challenge. He was isolated enough — a Jew on Murano, motherless, fatherless, dependent on this furnace for his livelihood and his craft — to have reason for loyalty. And he was young enough, perhaps, to be shaped by the argument before his principles hardened against it.

No. Bardolino pressed his palms flat on the desk again and felt the warmth and knew the answer before the argument was finished. Enzo was too young, yes. But that was not the reason, and Bardolino, who was an honest man in the deepest privacy of his own skull even when he was dishonest everywhere else, made himself name the true one. Enzo was too much like Giacomo. Too rigid in his distinctions, too certain that a line existed between what a man made and what a man permitted to be made from his making. Giacomo had believed that a craftsman bore responsibility beyond the edge of his workbench, that the act of creation did not end when the object left his hands.

And Giacomo —

Bardolino's fingers closed around the millefiori piece, hard, the edges of the cane slices pressing into his palm.

No. Not that. Not tonight.

He swept the three ducats back into the pouch and drew the string tight. He locked the pouch in the cabinet with the diagrams. He closed the account books and locked them in the desk's lower drawer, where they could continue their slow catastrophe in the dark. The candle on the desk had burned to a stub, the tallow pooling in its dish, and he pinched the wick between his scarred finger and thumb and sat for a moment in the darkness, feeling the heat from below and listening to the furnace's banked murmur, that low constant voice that had been the first sound of his mornings and the last of his nights for longer than the boy had been alive.

Twelve more lenses. Perhaps six weeks of work, if he ground the forms himself and left the finishing to the senior journeymen. Six weeks, and the commission would be complete, and the money would be in his hands, and the diagrams would go into the fire, and no one — not the guild, not the Ten, not the boy with his father's quiet eyes — would ever need to know what had passed through this furnace in the spring of 1494.

He descended the stairs slowly, his right leg stiff on the narrow treads. The workshop floor was dark, the tools racked, the benches clean. Only the furnace lived, its mouth sealed with the iron door, a thin line of orange visible at the base where the bricks had shifted and the seal was imperfect. He crossed to it and stood where he always stood — close enough to feel the heat on his face, on the scarred backs of his hands, on the front of his wool robe where the fabric grew warm and then hot and then almost unbearable, so that he had to step back, and then stepped forward again, because the discomfort was honest and the heat was honest and the fire, at least, did not require him to justify what he fed it.
